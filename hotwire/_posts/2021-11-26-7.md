Welcome to a special Black Friday edition of the ‚ö°Ô∏è Hotwire dev newsletter! I know the newsletter is usually once a month, but there are a few Hotwire and Rails Black Friday deals I couldn't help but share. If you're looking to level up your Rails skills or kickstart your next product then look no further than these discounts.

And to be doubly clear, this edition is an exception. Don't expect another deals newsletter until next Black Friday.
