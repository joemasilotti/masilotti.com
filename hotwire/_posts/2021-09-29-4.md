## üéâ Hotwire 1.0

{% include link.html
  title="DHH announces Hotwire 1.0"
  url="https://world.hey.com/dhh/stimulus-3-turbo-7-hotwire-1-0-9d507133"
  body="Official releases of [Stimulus 3](https://world.hey.com/hotwired/stimulus-3-c438d432) and [Turbo 7](https://world.hey.com/hotwired/turbo-7-0dd7a27f) make up Hotwire 1.0. Updates to Stimulus include the Values and CSS Classes API. 3.0 brings the ability to pass action method params. This means you can set an ‚Äúinteger‚Äù data item and Stimulus will automatically parse it - reducing the need for even more custom JavaScript."
