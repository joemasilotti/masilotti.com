Welcome back to the ‚ö°Ô∏è Hotwire dev newsletter! If you check out one thing from this edition I recommend the Remote Ruby interview with DDH on Rails 7. It's so inspiring to hear someone with this much passion for Rails talk about the framework.

I'm linking to Reddit for the first time üò± with a surprisingly healthy conversation on Hotwire vs. JavaScript front-end frameworks. There's also some great tutorials this month like how to build authentication from scratch, side-by-side code comparisons of Rails 6 vs. 7, replacing Rails UJS, and more.

Oh! I've been building [`railsdevs`](https://railsdevs.com) in public for the past few months and I'd love if you could check it out. It's a reverse job board for Rails developers looking for their next gig. The best part? It's [open source](https://github.com/joemasilotti/railsdevs.com) and contributions are welcome!
