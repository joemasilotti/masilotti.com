Welcome to the first edition of the ‚ö°Ô∏è Hotwire dev newsletter and thanks for subscribing! For a quick introduction, I‚Äôm Joe Masilotti and I blog about Rails, iOS, and testing on [Masilotti.com](https://masilotti.com/). I also [tweet about](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti) how I port Ruby on Rails to mobile apps with Turbo Native.

I‚Äôm starting this newsletter with the basics: where to find help/documentation and how to get started with Hotwire. I‚Äôm also including a few useful links I‚Äôve been gathering since Hotwire was announced at the beginning of the year.

If you find (or publish!) Hotwire content and would like it included in the next edition then reply to this email. You can also reach out [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti).

## üìÑ Documentation and support

### Official documentation

Turbo and Stimulus have their fair share of first-party documentation. I recommend reading through the handbooks to get started then diving into the reference docs for specific questions.

* Official Turbo [handbook](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/handbook/introduction) and [reference](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/reference/drive)
* Official Stimulus [handbook](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/handbook/introduction) and [reference](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/reference/controllers)

### Community support

There‚Äôs also a fairly active community forum, [Hotwire Discussion](https://discuss.hotwired.dev/), where Basecamp employees are known to answer questions. On May 9, [DHH mentioned](https://discuss.hotwired.dev/t/basecamp-plans-with-hotwire/2781/6) that Basecamp will continue Hotwire development after a short break to regroup.

> Basecamp will continue its development and patronage of Hotwire. We are taking a break to regroup, then will be back at it in a bit, working with whoever is interested in collaborating on the project.

As expected with open source projects, [GitHub](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo/issues) [issues](https://github.com/hotwired/stimulus/issues) are still a great place to get answers to specific questions. StackOverflow doesn‚Äôt have a tag for Hotwire yet, but you can ususally find what you need via [#turbo](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/turbo) and [#stimulusjs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/stimulusjs). Helping organize these tags is an opportunity to gain some SO karma!

## ü§∑ Where‚Äôs Strada?

When Hotwire was announced earlier this year we were promised that ‚ÄúStrada will premiere in 2021.‚Äù Sadly, with all that‚Äôs happened at Basecamp recently, Strada seems to be delayed.

If anyone has any information or insights on where Strada is, or what it might be, please let me know! You can reply to this email or [reach out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti).

My guess is that it will simplify interaction between Turbo Native clients and the web JavaScript. Maybe HTML markup powered by data-attributes to streamline the JavaScript bridge a bit more than the current [4 step process](https://masilotti.com/turbo-ios/the-javascript-bridge/).
