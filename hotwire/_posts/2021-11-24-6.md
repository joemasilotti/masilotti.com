Welcome back to the ‚ö°Ô∏è Hotwire dev newsletter! This month we have a podcast with Basecamp's lead Android developer, a few Hotwire-powered open source projects, and tons of tutorials. In Turbo news, [v7.1.0 saw three separate release candidates](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo/releases/tag/v7.1.0-rc.1), which now replicates all of `rails-ujs` functionality. This includes confirmation dialogs, disabling forms on submit, and more.

I'm also excited to announce that [railsdevs.com](https://railsdevs.com) is officially live! A "reverse job board" for Rails devs that strives to give power back to the independent developer. Instead of companies posting their jobs, developers post their profiles. The site is powered by Rails and [open source](https://github.com/joemasilotti/railsdevs.com/) ‚Äì I'd love if you could add your developer profile or contribute some code.
