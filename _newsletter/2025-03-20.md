Hey again,

I've been heads down on my new bridge component library so I'll keep this one short. Here are a few quick updates for you this week:

## More bridge components ðŸŽ‰

Since we last spoke, Iâ€™ve added a new free componentÂ and two new paid components to the [Bridge Components repo](https://github.com/joemasilotti/bridge-components). Use these to check permission status, present native share sheets, and scan barcodes.

Reminder: Use the promo code ~~**REDACTED**~~ for 50% offÂ before it expires next week.

## Book content = done âœ…

The last two chapters are in! That means the core content of Hotwire Native for Rails Developers is complete. If youâ€™ve been waiting, nowâ€™s the perfect time to grab a copy and lock in the beta discount before the final release.

## Chat with Dave Thomas ðŸŽ§

I had the pleasure of [chatting with Dave Thomas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X3tgyr7umI), co-author of The Pragmatic Programmer and co-founder of The Pragmatic Bookshelf. We discussed how to quickly build and launch a mobile MVP with minimal ongoing maintenance.

Until next time - thanks!
