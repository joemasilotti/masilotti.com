Hey all,

I’m excited to announce Hotwire Native Live, a brand-new livestream where we’ll build real Hotwire Native features together. And you get to ask questions in real time.

Episode #1 kicks off **Thursday at 11am PT on** [**YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/live/oi_dU4GlGwc). Here’s what we’ll cover:

1. Starting from scratch on both iOS and Android
2. Adding a native tab bar to each app
3. Customizing icons and styles to match your branding
4. Dedicated Q&A for live viewers

Whether you’re already familiar with Hotwire Native or just curious, you’ll walk away with working code you can drop into your own projects and tips to speed up your workflow.
