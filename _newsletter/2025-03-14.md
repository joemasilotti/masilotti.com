Hotwire Native makes it easier than ever to build native-feeling mobile apps powered by your Rails server. But when you need *truly* native UI elements like menus, toasts, and push notifications, youâ€™re usually stuck writing custom Swift and Kotlin code.

Iâ€™ve been solving this problem for years in client projects. And now, Iâ€™m sharing myÂ **bridge component library**Â to help you do the same! This is an exclusive first look just for newsletter subscribers.

### ðŸ‘‰Â [Check it out on GitHub](https://github.com/joemasilotti/bridge-components)

The repository includesÂ **production-ready bridge components**Â extracted from real-world apps. Once configured, you can add them to any page of your app. All you need to do is add some HTML.

For example, to add a native menu to your apps, copy and paste the relevant files then add the following HTML to a view.

```html
<div data-controller="bridge--menu">
  <a href="/one"
    data-bridge--menu-target="item"
    data-bridge-title="One"
    data-bridge-ios-image="1.circle"
    data-bridge-android-image="counter_1">
      One
  </a>

  <!-- More links... -->
</div>
```

This adds a button to the navigation bar that, when tapped, renders a native menu powered by `UIMenu` on iOS and `DropdownMenu` on Android. The title and image of each item in the menu are fully customizable by those `data-bridge-*` attributes.

Beautiful! ðŸ¤Œ

Other components provide native dialogs, buttons, toasts, and more. The repo includes working demo apps for iOS and Android along with a companion Rails app. Hereâ€™s what that looks like on iOS.
