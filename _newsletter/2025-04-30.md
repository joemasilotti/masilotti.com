Hey everyone,

Hotwire Native v1.2 dropped this week and it’s "the biggest update since the initial launch last year" according to Jay Ohms!

This release includes a bunch of new features around routing URLs in your apps. **Route decision handlers** make it easier to customize behavior around external URLs. And **server-driven historical location urls** are now baked into the apps - you no longer need to add them to your path configuration. Check out [the announcement post](https://dev.37signals.com/announcing-hotwire-native-v1-2/) for more details.

But I’m most excited for the new **first-party tab bar components**. So much so, that I created a 15 minute video on how to add them to brand new Hotwire Native iOS and Android apps.

## New demo apps

The release also includes a [brand new demo app](https://hotwire-native-demo.dev/), rebuilt entirely in Ruby on Rails.

It’s now easier to see how Hotwire Native concepts apply when building Rails apps. There are examples for bridge components, path configuration, redirects, flash messages, and more. Check out [the source code](https://github.com/hotwired/hotwire-native-demo) for all the details.

I lead the development of this project and am excited to finally share it with you.

Until next time!
