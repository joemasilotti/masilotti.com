Hotwire Native is a game changer for Rails developers looking to build apps for iOS and Android. It enables you to create intuitive and maintainable mobile apps powered by the technology you already know: Ruby on Rails.

In this book, you'll leverage existing content from your Rails app to build an iOS and Android app from scratch. You'll progressively enhance these apps with native components and screens.

By the end of this book, you'll be able to work with confidence across multiple platforms and understand the benefits of native versus web to build for any SDK and any API.

## Readers will learn...

1. **Work with confidence across multiple platforms**: Hybrid apps are most impactful when launched across multiple platforms. Readers will learn how to build for the web, iOS, and Android with confidence.
1. **Cultivate the Hotwire Native mindset**: Building effective Hotwire Native apps means leaving as much business logic as possible on the server. Readers will learn how to cultivate this mindset and how this creates low-maintenance, server-driven apps.
1. **Understand the benefits of native vs. web**: Building and maintaining native screens and components requires a lot of effort. But sometimes the additional fidelity is worth it. Readers will learn when and why it makes sense to upgrade to native.
1. **Build for any SDK and any API**: One of the biggest benefits of mobile apps is access to the underlying platform SDKs and APIs not available on the web. Readers will learn the patterns to follow and best practices for working with Swift, Kotlin, Rails, and Hotwire Native to develop their own native features so they can interact with any native interface, current or future.
1. **Avoid Hotwire Native pitfalls and gotchas**: Hybrid still has some trade-offs. Readers will learn where it falls short and what to watch out for when building their apps.
