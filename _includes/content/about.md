<p class="lead mt-12">I help folks <a href="{% link _pages/services.liquid %}">confidently</a> launch iOS and Android apps with Hotwire Native and Ruby on Rails.</p>

I started by journey in 2012 at Pivotal Labs where I learned Ruby on Rails, test-driven development, and pair programming.

After Labs I worked for a startup for 5 years as the lead developer. I built the iOS and Android apps with Hotwire Native and advice from the team at Basecamp. Back when it was still called Turbolinks!

At the beginning of 2020 I decided to stake out on my own and went independent. Since then I've worked on a bunch of side projects and launched dozens of apps in the App Store and Google Play.

Now I'm focused on spreading Hotwire Native and teaching developers what it takes to be a solopreneur. Here are three things I'm super excited about right now:

1. [Hotwire Native for Rails Developers]({{ site.data.urls.book }}) - My book on Hotwire Native, published by The Pragmatic Bookshelf.
1. [Bridge Components](https://github.com/joemasilotti/bridge-components) - A collection of free bridge components for Hotwire Native apps.
1. [Hotwire Native by example]({% link _hotwire_native/index.liquid %}) - A series of focused and actionable tutorials on building Hotwire Native apps.
