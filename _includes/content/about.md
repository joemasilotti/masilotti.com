<p class="lead mt-12">I help folks <a href="{% link _pages/services.liquid %}">confidently</a> launch iOS and Android apps with Hotwire Native and Ruby on Rails.</p>

I started by journey in 2012 at Pivotal Labs where I learned Ruby on Rails, test-driven development, and pair programming.

After Labs I worked for a startup for 5 years as the lead developer. I built the iOS and Android apps with Hotwire Native and advice from the team at Basecamp. Back when it was still called Turbolinks!

At the beginning of 2020 I decided to stake out on my own and went independent. Since then I've worked on a bunch of side projects and launched dozens of apps in the App Store.

Now I'm focused on spreading Hotwire Native and teaching developers what it takes to be a solopreneur. I'm sharing my journey as the solo-founder of transparent businesses like [RailsDevs](https://railsdevs.com), the _reverse_ job board for Ruby on Rails developers.
