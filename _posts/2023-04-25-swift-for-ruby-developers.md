title: Swift for Ruby developers crash course
date: 2023-04-25
description: If you're a Ruby or Rails developer looking to dive into iOS development, this crash course on Swift is exactly what you need! Ideal for anyone interested in Turbo Native development.
---

On Thursday I hosted a 40-minute crash course on Swift + iOS. The session was aimed at Ruby + Rails developers who want to [build Turbo Native apps]({% post_url 2021-05-14-turbo-ios %}) but lack knowledge of Swift and iOS.

I covered the fundamentals of Swift and iOS, and compared and contrasted each concept to Ruby and Rails, making it easier for web developers to understand.

If you missed the live stream you can [watch the recording on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/live/H58Tj-i2aSE?start=129). Read on for a breakdown of the Swift topics with copy-pasteable code snippets.

## Getting started with Swift

To get started, you will need Xcode installed. You can [download the latest version](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) from Apple’s Developer site for free.

To demonstrate Swift we will use a [Playground](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/). Its kind of like being able to edit and run a Ruby file without leaving your editor.

To create a new playground, open Xcode and click File → New → Playground. Then select Blank and click Next.

Give your Playground a name (or leave the default) and click Create.

## Constants vs. variables

In Ruby, you can set a variable over and over again.

```ruby
x = 1
x = 2
```

Even constants can be overwritten! (With a warning.)

```ruby
CONSTANT = "IMPORTANT TEXT"
CONSTANT = "SOMETHING ELSE"
# (irb):2: warning: already initialized constant CONSTANT
# (irb):1: warning: previous definition of CONSTANT was here
```

But in Swift you must decide if a variable can be modified. Declare a mutable variable with `var` and one that cannot be changed with `let`.

```swift
var x = 1
x = 2

let name = "Joe"
name = "Duke" // ERROR: Cannot assign to value: 'name' is a 'let' constant
```

Click the arrow at the bottom left of the editor to run the Playground, or `⌘ ⇧ ↵`.

![Run playground](/assets/images/swift-for-ruby-developers/run-playground.png){:standalone}

## Types

Ruby variables assume the type of whatever is assigned to them.

```ruby
x = 1
x.class # => Integer

x = "Joe"
x.class # => String
```

Swift requires explicit, static typing. And once the type is assigned it can never be changed.

Tip: `⌥ + Click` on a variable to see its type in Xcode.

![⌥ + Click to view decleration](/assets/images/swift-for-ruby-developers/option-click.png){:standalone}

```swift
var x = 1 // Int
x = "Joe" // ERROR: Cannot assign value of type 'String' to type 'Int'
```

## Optionals

In Ruby, any variable could potentially be `nil`.

```ruby
x = 1
x = nil

hash = {"breakfast": "eggs", "lunch": "sandwich"}
hash["breakfast"] # => eggs
hash["snack"] # => nil
```

In Swift, variables must be explicitly declared as optional.

```swift
var x: Int = 1
x = nil // ERROR: 'nil' cannot be assigned to type 'Int'

// Note the question mark - this is an optional Int.
var y: Int? = 1
y = nil

let dictionary = ["breakfast": "eggs", "lunch": "sandwich"]
let breakfast = dictionary["breakfast"] // String?
let snack = dictionary["snack"] // String?
```

Notice how both variables are strings with a question mark? The compiler knows that these can be *either* a string or `nil`. This is an optional type.

To use optionals we need to *unwrap* them.

### Force unwrap

We can *force unwrap* an optional with a bang, `!`. But if a `nil` is force unwrapped it will crash the app.

```swift
"2x " + breakfast! // "2x eggs"
"2x " + snack! // FATAL ERROR: Unexpectedly found `nil` while unwrapping an Optional value
```

### Optional binding

If you're not sure if a variable can be `nil` or not then *optional binding* is a safer choice. If the right hand side is `nil` then the body of the `if` statement won’t run, avoiding a crash.

```swift
if let breakfast = breakfast {
    "2x + " breakfast // "2x eggs"
}

if let snack = snack {
   "2x " + snack // Never run!
}
```

We can also use the shorthand syntax if the new variable shares the same name.

```swift
if let breakfast {
    "2x + " breakfast // "2x eggs"
}
```

## Classes and functions

Creating a class in Swift is very similar to Ruby. Instead of a `do` `end` block we use braces.

```swift
class Person {}

let person = Person()
```

By default functions don't return anything, "void functions". But a return type can be added.

```swift
class Person {
    // Does not return anything.
    func eat() {
        // Go eat something.
    }

    // Must return a string.
    func sayHi() -> String {
        return "Hello"
    }
}

let person = Person()
person.eat()
person.sayHi() // "Hello"
```

Function parameters in Swift behave like named parameters in Ruby.

```swift
func eat(food: String) {
    print("Eating \(food)... Yum!")
}

eat(food: "pizza") // "Eating pizza... Yum!"
```

We can omit the parameter name at the call site by declaring the parameter with an underscore.

```swift
func drink(_ beverage: String) {
    print("Drinking \(beverage)... Delicious!")
}

// Note how we omitted the parameter name.
drink("coffee") // "Drinking coffee... Delicious!"
```

## Static vs. Dynamic typed language

Ruby is an implicitly typed language. Or, duck-typed. If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, well, it’s probably a duck. So let's treat it like one.

This means we can attempt to call any method on any object in our system. And Ruby will figure out at runtime if that instance can actually handle it.

```ruby
class Dog
  def say_hi
    "Woof"
  end
end

class Cat
  def say_hi
    "Meow"
  end
end

Dog.new.say_hi # => "Woof"
Cat.new.say_hi # => "Meow"

animals = [Dog.new, Cat.new]
animals.map { animal do
  animal.say_hi # => ["Woof", "Meow"]
end
```

But Swift is statically typed. We can only call a method the compiler knows an instance will respond to. Otherwise we will get a build time error.

```swift
class Dog {
    func sayHi() -> String {
        return "Woof"
    }
}

class Cat {
    func sayHi() -> String {
        return "Meow"
    }
}

Dog().sayHi() // "Woof"
Cat().sayHi() // "Meow"

// Note the generic typing of the array as Any, or "anything".
let animals: [Any] = [Dog(), Cat()]
animals.map { animal in
    animal.sayHi() // ERROR: Value of type 'Any' has no member 'sayHi'
}
```

To get around this we need to introduce a common interface. An API that tells the compiler that both `Cat` and `Dog` can say hi. In Swift, we call this a protocol.

## Protocols

A protocol defines method signatures, only. It leaves the implementation to the class itself.

```swift
protocol Animal {
    func sayHello() -> String
}
```

Now we can have each animal conform to the `Animal` protocol.

```swift
class Dog: Animal {
    func sayHi() -> String {
        return "Woof"
    }
}

class Cat: Animal {
    func sayHi() -> String {
        return "Meow"
    }
}

// Note the new explicit type of the array.
let animals: [Animal] = [Dog(), Cat()]
animals.map { animal in
    animal.sayHi() // "Woof", "Meow"
}
```

## Extensions

We can make our code a bit tidier by implementing the protocol in an extension instead of directly in the class.

```swift
class Dog {}

extension Dog: Animal {
    func sayHi() -> String {
        return "Woof"
    }
}
```

If `Dog` implemented a few different protocols we can organize the relevant methods in their own areas of the codebase.

We can also add functionality to classes we don’t even own with an extension. Here we are adding a function to see if an integer is 42 or not. We don’t own `Int`, it’s part of the standrd Swift library!

```swift
extension Int {
    func is42() -> Bool {
        self == 42
    }
}

42.is42() // true
33.is42() // false
```

That wraps up my Swift crash course for Ruby developers. I’d love to hear your feedback! If you have any suggestions for other topics please [send me an email](mailto:joe@masilotti.com).
