title: 🎙 Positivity and railsdevs - guest on The Ruby on Rails podcast

---

Last week I had the pleasure of joining Brittany Martin and Brian Mariani on The Ruby on Rails podcast. We covered building railsdevs in public, some challenges I've been facing, and a few technical decisions I'm proud of.

We also touched on my upcoming workshop, How to port your Rails app to iOS with Turbo Native. It was an absolute blast and I can't wait to meet Brittany and Brian in person at Rails Conf next month!
