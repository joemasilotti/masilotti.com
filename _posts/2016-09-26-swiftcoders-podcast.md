Earlier this month I spoke on the [SwiftCoders podcast](http://swiftcoders.podbean.com/e/25-joe-masilotti-lead-developer-at-beermenus) with the host, [Garric Nahapetian](https://twitter.com/garricn). We talked about getting started in Swift, how I went from a job at a big bank to the being the lead developer for BeerMenus, and, obviously, testing.

If you have a few minutes go have a listen. And make sure to check out the other episodes.
