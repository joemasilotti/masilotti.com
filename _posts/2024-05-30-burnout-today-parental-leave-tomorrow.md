My second son will be born in a few days. And Iâ€™m doing everything I can to spend as much time with him as possible: Tomorrow is my last day of work before I take four months of parental leave.

Which means this is my last post until October! ðŸ˜¢

And the scary part about the parental leave is that it is *unpaid* parental leave.

Iâ€™m self-employed and the vast majority of my income comes from consulting.Â I help businesses bring their Rails apps to the app stores with [Turbo Native]({% link _pages/services.liquid %}). So if Iâ€™m not consulting, well, Iâ€™m not making any money.

To meet my income goal regardless, **I crammed 12 months of work into 5**. As expected, I burned out hard.

I knew this would happen to be honest. I set out to work 2-3x more than usual - how could it not! But even a "planned" burnout is still a burnout. Knowing itâ€™s coming doesnâ€™t make it suck any less.

For me, burnout manifests this weird state of *wanting* to be on my computer all the time. But when I actually sit down... I canâ€™t *do* anything. I feel bad about not working but canâ€™t do the work I need to do!

What I want to do when burned out is work harder or more. "Surely I can work *through* this!" I tell myself. As expected, that never works. And only makes me feel even worse about what Iâ€™m not accomplishing.

Since this isnâ€™t my first burnout, I kinda sorta know how to fix it. The only *real* solution, for me, is to take time off. A week of vacation can sometimes do it. But I usually need something more substantial.

Lucky for me I have four workless months coming up! Itâ€™s no vacation, letâ€™s be clear. Iâ€™ll be exhausted in other ways with a newborn and toddler in the house. But when I come back in October at least the work-side of my brain will be ready to resume [my newsletter]({{ site.data.urls.newsletter }}), finish [my book]({% link _pages/book.liquid %}), and dive back in.

Thatâ€™s the hope, at least. See you in October! ðŸ™‚
