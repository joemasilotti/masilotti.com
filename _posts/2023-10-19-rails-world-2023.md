description: Turbo Native gives Rails developers superpowers. Learn how in the recording of my Rails World talk in Amsterdam.

I had the honor of speaking at the inaugural [Rails World conference](https://rubyonrails.org/world) in Amsterdam earlier this month. I gave a talk on Turbo Native and how it gives Rails developers superpowers.

Skip ahead to 5:48 to watch me build a Turbo Native iOS app from scratch, _live_. 😱

I also cover ways to make the app feel more native, how to integrate with native Swift SDKs, and review some before/after Strada examples.

The talk is a great resource if you’re new to Turbo Native or want a refresher on the _why_ of the framework. But I think anyone who is interested in hybrid apps can learn something new.

If you give it a watch please [let me know](mailto:joe@masilotti.com). I’d love to hear what you think!
