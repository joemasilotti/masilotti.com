Hey everyone, how‚Äôs your week going?

I started working on a new series of tutorials, added a new component to my bridge component library, and was accepted to speak at an upcoming conference. Overall, a really exciting week! üòÅ

## Hotwire Native by example

I‚Äôm putting together a new series of articles - a collection of **focused** and **actionable** tutorials on building Hotwire Native iOS and Android apps.

I haven‚Äôt announced them to the public yet. But I wanted to share what I have so far with you. And see if it is worth continuing.

Check them out on [my website]({% link _pages/hotwire-native.liquid %}). I‚Äôve written two articles so far and will be adding more soon.

I‚Äôve also sketched out ideas for future content. I‚Äôd love to know what you think of the list. I‚Äôm all ears for new ideas!

## Bridge component library updates

The official launch of the [bridge component library](https://github.com/joemasilotti/bridge-components) went *really* well. There‚Äôs already 200+ stars on GitHub and **more than 50 Rails developers** purchased a Pro license! ü§© Thank you to everyone who helped for the support.

There‚Äôs also been some great chatter in [Discussions](https://github.com/joemasilotti/bridge-components/discussions) with one¬†conversation leading to a brand new component, a [document scanner](https://github.com/joemasilotti/bridge-components/tree/main/components/document-scanner). This was a lot of fun to build and really shows off how powerful Hotwire Native apps can get.

If you missed the newsletter-exclusive 50% discount code then you can use ~~**REDACTED**~~ for 25% off of a Pro license through the end of the month.

## RailsConf 2025

Finally‚Ä¶¬†my CFP was accepted and I‚Äôll be speaking at the [final RailsConf in July](https://railsconf.org)!

I‚Äôm hosting a two hour workshop on Wednesday. Join me and build Hotwire Native iOS and Android apps from scratch. Learn the essentials, practical tips, and common pitfalls I‚Äôve picked up since working with the framework since 2016.

A huge thank you to the committee for accepting my proposal. ü§ó

Who will I see at RailsConf this year? I‚Äôd love to meet IRL!
