Hey y’all, who’s going to be at RailsConf this week?

I’m hosting a [Hotwire Native workshop on Wednesday at 10:15am]({% link _pages/slides/railsconf-2025.liquid %}). And I’d love to see you there!

During this two-hour session, you’ll build an iOS and Android app from scratch. You’ll learn the essentials, practical tips, and common pitfalls of building maintainable Hotwire Native apps.

And the best part? Zero Swift or Kotlin experience is required!

A thin wrapper for each platform enables continuous updates by only making changes to your Rails codebase. Deploy your code, and all three platforms get your changes immediately.

Before you attend, be sure your development environment is set up. You’ll need:

- macOS
- Ruby 3.4 (or higher)
- Xcode 16 (*not* Xcode 26)
- Android Studio Meerkat (or later)
- SQLite 3.8 (or higher)

And make sure to clone [this Rails demo app](https://github.com/joemasilotti/hotwire-native-blog-demo) and run the quick start via `bin/setup`.

Hit reply or [send me an email](mailto:joe@masilotti.com) if you run into any issues.

## Meet the Authors

Later that day I’ll also be at the Meet the Authors table at 3pm.

This is a great opportunity to get more information on my book, [*Hotwire Native for Rails Developers*]({{ site.data.urls.book }}), and pick my brain.

I’ll also be giving out event-exclusive discount codes and running a book giveaway.
