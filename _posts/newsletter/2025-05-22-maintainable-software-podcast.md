Did you know you can spin up mobile iOS and Android apps in under an hour? That’s exactly what Robby Russel and I covered on a recent edition of the Maintainable Software podcast.

Yes, we talked a lot about Hotwire Native (of course!) but we also dove into some other exciting topics I don’t normally get to chat about publicly. I shared:

- What I consider when deciding if a codebase is maintainable
- How to onboard with new clients as quickly as possible
- Project-based engagements vs. getting paid hourly

> "It’s an almost direct correlation between how quickly I can get a Rails app running and how maintainable the software is."

You can listen directly on the [Maintainable Software Podcast website](https://maintainable.fm/episodes/joe-masilotti-simplify-your-stack-ship-mobile-sooner), which has links to all the major podcast players.

Speaking of podcast appearances, I recently put together a [new page on my website]({% link _pages/speaking.liquid %}). It gathers all of the conference talks, workshops, and podcasts I’ve been a guest on over the years. 13 and counting!

The sharp eye will also notice that there are two "upcoming" conference talks right at the top. That’s right folks, this year I’ll be speaking at both **🚀 Rails Conf** *and* 🌍 **Rails World**!

Who’s coming? Reply and let me know which session you’ll catch me at, and we can grab a beverage together!
