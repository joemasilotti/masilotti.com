Hey folks! How’s your week going so far?

In case you missed it, [Apple announced iOS 26](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26/) at WWDC on Monday. And with it comes a brand new design, *Liquid Glass*.

> This translucent material reflects and refracts its surroundings, while dynamically transforming to help bring greater focus to content, delivering a new level of vitality across controls, navigation, app icons, widgets, and more. For the very first time, the new design extends across platforms — iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 261 — to establish even more harmony while maintaining the distinct qualities that make each unique.

This week I’m exploring what this means for Hotwire Native developers. Short answer: I think we are in *very* good shape.

Unlike other hybrid platforms that rebuild every single element to match the system UI (React Native), Hotwire Native apps rely on using the first-party components directly.

To demonstrate, when working through my [book on Hotwire Native](https://pragprog.com/titles/jmnative/hotwire-native-for-rails-developers/), you build an app to track hikes. Here’s what it looks like when running on iOS 26.

**This required zero code changes.** And we get all of the new design from Liquid Glass. For free!

I’ll be exploring this and the new SwiftUI WebKit API in an upcoming video on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@joemasilotti) later this month.

And speaking of YouTube…

## Hotwire Native LIVE #3

Join me today (Thursday) at 11am PT / 1 pm ET for [episode #3 of Hotwire Native LIVE](https://youtube.com/live/xHbYIsfbYzY).

This week we're covering **debugging**: enabling Hotwire Native's logging, attaching a browser for inspecting JavaScript, and figuring out cryptic IDE messages.

And as always, I’ve dedicated time at the end for Q&A so you can get real-time feedback and troubleshooting help. Come say hi!

## New bridge component and marketing site

This week I also extracted a new bridge component from a client’s app. The free [Theme Component](https://github.com/joemasilotti/bridge-components/tree/main/components/theme) helps keep the system UI in sync with your web-based design.

![Theme Component example screenshots](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/2e73b082-fc5c-443a-8d58-aa69a36c83a7.png?w=960&fit=max){:standalone .unstyled}

And to celebrate, I’ve also created a real [marketing page](https://masilotti.com/bridge-components/) for the component library!

If you’ve used the library and would like to add a testimonial then please let me know. I’d love to include your quote or company logo on the page for social proof.

That’s all for this week - hopefully I’ll see you at the live stream!

Talk soon,
