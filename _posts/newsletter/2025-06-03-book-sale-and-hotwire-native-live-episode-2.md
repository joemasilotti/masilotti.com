Hey folks! Can you believe it's June already? The summer has officially begun in Portland. I mean, just look at that forecast. 😍

## Hotwire Native LIVE

Last week I ran the first [Hotwire Native LIVE](https://youtube.com/live/oi_dU4GlGwc) episode on YouTube. I built an iOS and Android app from scratch and answered 20+ questions from viewers. Between YouTube and Twitter, the recording has already been viewed over 2000 times. 😲

And this week I'm covering **bridge components**: what they are, how to add them to your iOS and Android apps, and examples of components I've built for clients. I'd love to see you there!

## Hotwire Native around the web

### [Seamless Loading with Hotwire Native](https://katalyst.com.au/articles/seamless-loading-hotwire-native-ios)

Stephen and Alan from Katalyst Interactive documented their approach to building a Hotwire Native app with seamless loading on launch. They weren't satisfied with their iOS app showing the native launch screen then dropping the user directly to a blank page with a spinner.

> By preloading the web view, detecting when it’s ready, and using a smooth crossfade transition, we made the Hotwire Native app feel truly native.

### [Custom Android Keyboard Extension](https://williamkennedy.ninja/hotwire-native/2025/05/23/up-and-running-with-hotwire-native-android-custom-android-keyboard-extension/)

William Kennedy wrapped up his series on Hotwire Native Android with an article on building a custom keyboard extension. He uses a bridge component to add a native toolbar when a Trix editor is focused. Users can then tap native buttons to toggle bold, italic, and headings.

> This is a great feature to build if you want to build a markdown editor in your app that’s accessible via mobile.

Until next time, everyone!
