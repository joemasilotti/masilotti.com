Native apps are hard. They’re expensive to build and even more expensive to maintain. But with Turbo Native, that’s no longer true.

The framework enables Rails developers like you and me to build high-fidelity hybrid apps with native navigation in a fraction of the time.

Turbo Native unlocks native apps for Rails developers in a way that avoids a maintenance nightmare. Adding a new feature to your Rails app is automatically available to your native apps — no rebuilding or resubmitting needed. And since you’re building mobile web views there’s not another framework or library to learn once you have Turbo Native set up.

I've been working with Turbo Native since 2015. Since then I've helped half a dozen businesses launch in the App Store and consulted for twice as many. I know the gotchas, trade offs, and best practices. If you want to know something about Turbo Native, there’s a good chance I’ve done it before.

The interactive workshop will be 3 hours long. You will learn how to use the native iOS Turbo wrapper to build high-fidelity hybrid apps with native navigation. Topics include:

1. Basic Turbo Native integration
1. Native look and feel
1. Web-based authentication
1. The JavaScript bridge
1. Native screens with SwiftUI

A good portion of the workshop is live coding – sometimes I'll be driving and other times you will be given prompts to complete with other attendees. Every topic will wrap up with a Q&A session.

**The next session will cost $499** and take place in early 2023.
