Welcome back to the ⚡️ Hotwire dev newsletter!

Two very exciting announcements this month: **Rails 7.1 beta** and **Strada** are here. 🥳

Check out the announcements below along with the premiere of a _Strada_ section of the newsletter. What do you think of the emoji? 🌉

I’ve spent most of the last month working on [my Turbo Native talk at Rails World](https://rubyonrails.org/world/agenda/day-2/6-joe-masilotti-se4ssion). I can’t believe I’m presenting _next week_! If you’re there come say hi – I’d love to meet you.

When I get back I’m thinking of doing another workshop, too. Something a bit more streamlined and affordable than before. **Two hours of hands-on Turbo Native training for $99** covering a basic integration, authentication, and Strada.

[Email me](mailto:joe@masilotti.com) to let me know you're interested! I’m figuring out dates soon.

## 📣 Announcements

### [Rails 7.1 beta](https://rubyonrails.org/2023/9/13/Rails-7-1-0-beta-1-has-been-released)

The first beta for Rails 7.1 is here with a lot of exciting features. I’m most excited about the new authentication-related additions which make it easier than ever to roll your own authentication. All without third-party libraries! 💪

Check out the full post for details on a default Dockerfile, async queries, and more.

### [Strada launch](https://dev.37signals.com/announcing-strada/)

After waiting for what feels like forever, I’m excited to finally explore the last missing piece of Hotwire. Strada is an optional add-on for Turbo Native apps that enables native components driven by the web. It unlocks *progressive enhancement* of individual controls without converting entire screens to native.

There’s so much Strada talk this month it gets its own section in the newsletter.

## 👩‍🏫 Tutorials

### [Turbo Forms & Drag and Drop in Ruby on Rails](https://code.avi.nyc/turbo-forms-drag-and-drop-in-ruby-on-rails-part-1)

by Avi Flombaum [@aviflombaum](https://twitter.com/aviflombaum)

Avi breaks down how to build drag and drop in Hotwire without relying on any Javascript plugins and minimal custom JavaScript. The tutorial walks you through creating a new playlist with validation, and even sneaks in a bit of inline Javascript to finesse the UI. Avi promises more on drag and drop functionality in the next part of this series.

### [Build Drag and Drop with Rails Hotwire](https://maful.web.id/posts/build-drag-and-drop-with-rails-hotwire/)

by Maful [@mafulprayoga](https://twitter.com/mafulprayoga)

A different take on drag and drop, Maful uses Sortable to handle the core of the visual and front-end changes. He wraps the library in a Stimulus controller to hand off data to the backend and update the UI. I recommend taking a look at both approaches and see which one works better for you! 💭

### [Using Turbo Frames for Navigation](https://www.railsreviews.com/articles/turbo-frames-navigation)

by Julian Rubisch [@julian_rubisch](https://twitter.com/julian_rubisch)

Turbo Frames for tabbed navigation seems like a good fit on paper. But there are a few gotchas you should know before diving in. Julian reviews each of them with a quick solution and working demo.

### [How to break out of a Turbo Frame and redirect?](https://www.ducktypelabs.com/turbo-break-out-and-redirect/)

by Sid Krishnan

Turbo Frames in Rails apps can make redirects tricky, especially after form submissions. Sid outlines three solutions: a meta tag approach that results in two GET requests, a JavaScript method that listens for a specific Turbo event but feels hacky, and a Rails-native method using Turbo Streams for custom actions.

## 🌉 Strada

### [Strada officially launched!]({% post_url 2023-09-21-strada-launch %})

by Joe Masilotti [@joemasilotti](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti)

A first look at Strada, the last missing piece of Hotwire. I explore how it unlocks native components driven by the web in Turbo Native apps. We walk through the demo code in the turbo-ios repo, covering each line of Strada code with examples and screenshots. 📱

### [Welcome Strada](https://world.hey.com/tonysm/welcome-strada-7ada634c)

by Tony Messias [@tonysmdev](https://twitter.com/tonysmdev)

A quick overview of what Strada is and how it helps Turbo Native developers. There’s also a great annotated screenshot of an HTML-to-native upgraded screen powered by Strada.

### [Get Started with Strada! A First Look on iOS](https://mileswoodroffe.com/articles/get-started-with-strada)

by Miles Woodroffe [@tapster](https://twitter.com/tapster)

A deeper dive, Miles walks through building a native menu on iOS powered by HTML and Strada. He copies some of the example code and shows how to integrate it into a Rails backend, instead of the Express.js code used in the demo apps.

## 📱 Turbo Native

### [Turbo Native Directory](https://turbonative.directory)

by Rob Zolkos [@robzolkos](https://twitter.com/robzolkos)

16 apps and counting! Rob put together an open source directory to list iOS and Android apps built with Turbo Native. As this grows I can see it being a great resource when trying to get buy-in for going hybrid. Make sure to add your app if you've built one.

### [turbo-native-initializer](https://github.com/lazaronixon/turbo-native-initializer)

by Lázaro Nixon [@lazaronixon](https://twitter.com/lazaronixon)

A new command line tool to generate Turbo Native iOS and Android apps! It adds a bunch of new features on top of the demo apps, including SwiftUI + Jetpack Compose UI for native code, `data-turbo-confirm` handling, and additional navigation flows. 🤩

### [Password-less SwiftUI Native Auth with Turbo iOS](https://mileswoodroffe.com/articles/passwordless-turbo-native-ios-auth)

by Miles Woodroffe [@tapster](https://twitter.com/tapster)

The conclusion to [password-less auth with Rails](https://mileswoodroffe.com/articles/passwordless-auth-with-rails), Miles follows up with the Turbo Native code needed to get this working on iOS. You’ll build a native authentication screen written in SwiftUI. And since its native, you have full control to make authenticated network requests outside of the Turbo web lifecycle.

### [Turbo Native: When to upgrade screens to native?]({% post_url 2023-08-29-when-to-upgrade-turbo-native-screens %})

by Joe Masilotti [@joemasilotti](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti)

Using Turbo Native for hybrid apps doesn't mean you have to use web views for every screen; sometimes you might need the higher fidelity of a native screen. There's no one-size-fits-all approach, and adding native screens can increase complexity and maintenance. When building Turbo Native apps for clients, I use these rough guidelines to help decide whether a screen should be native or web-based.
