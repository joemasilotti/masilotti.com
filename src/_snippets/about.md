<p class="lead">I help folks confidently launch iOS apps in the App Store with Turbo Native and Ruby on Rails.</p>

I started by journey in 2012 at Pivotal Labs where I learned Ruby on Rails, test-driven development, and pair programming.

After Labs I worked for a startup for 5 years as the lead developer. I built the iOS and Android apps with Turbo Native and advice from the team at Basecamp. Back when it was still called Turbolinks!

At the beginning of 2020 I decided to stake out on my own and went independent. Since then I've worked on a bunch of side projects and launched dozens of apps in the App Store.

Now I'm focused on spreading Turbo Native and teaching developers what it takes to be a solopreneur. I'm sharing my journey as the solo-founder of transparent businesses like [RailsDevs](https://railsdevs.com), the _reverse_ job board for Ruby on Rails developers.
