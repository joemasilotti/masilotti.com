<p class="lead">I help folks confidently launch iOS apps in the App Store with Turbo Native and Ruby on Rails.</p>

I've been working with Turbo Native since 2015, back when it was still called Turbolinks. Since then I've helped half dozens of businesses launch in the App Store.

Since learning Ruby on Rails back at Pivotal Labs in 2012 I've launched a bunch of side projects and businesses. I even sold one!

Now I'm sharing my journey as the solo-founder of transparent businesses like [RailsDevs](https://railsdevs.com), the _reverse_ job board for Ruby on Rails developers. Follow along by subscribing to my newsletter.
