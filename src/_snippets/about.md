<p class="lead">I help businesses build and launch hybrid iOS apps powered by Turbo Native and Ruby on Rails.</p>

I've been working with [Turbo Native](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-ios) since 2015, back when it was still called Turbolinks. Since then I've helped half a dozen businesses launch in the App Store.

I write about [how to use Turbo Native](/articles) and built a paid [code template](https://jumpstartrails.com/ios) to _jumpstart_ your project. Check out my [services](/services) to see how I can help you launch in the App Store.

Every month I send the ⚡️ [Hotwire dev newsletter](/hotwire), a curated round-up of the latest Hotwire articles, code, courses, and more. This is the best place to keep up with my upcoming workshops and latest work.

This month I'm kicking off the first [Turbo Native workshop](/turbo-native-workshop). This 3-hour virtual workshop will teach attendees how to port their own Rails apps to iOS with Turbo Native.

Outside of Turbo Native I'm the founder of [RailsDevs](https://railsdevs.com), a reverse job board for Ruby on Rails developers. Even though I launched only a year ago, RailsDevs has already placed 30+ developers with jobs.
