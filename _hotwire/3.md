title: "⚡️ Hotwire dev newsletter - Edition #3"

---

Welcome back to the ⚡️ Hotwire dev newsletter! This edition has a lot of great tutorials along with a full-featured book on Rails development. I'm extra excited about the first two links: building a Twitter clone and HEY-inspired pop-ups.

You'll also notice a new section, Jobs. This includes both employers looking to hire Rails devs and individuals who are looking for Rails work. If you're on either end of the market, [send me an email](mailto:joe@masilotti.com) to get added to the next edition.
