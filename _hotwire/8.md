Welcome back to the ⚡️ Hotwire dev newsletter! The first Rails 7 release candidate dropped and oh boy am I excited. The biggest change is "all new answers on the front-end" which means you can kiss Webpacker goodbye. We also have a brand new podcast from Jared White, why DHH thinks "the time is right for Hotwire", and an in-depth article on building a real-time chat app.

I'm also excited to announce that [railsdevs](https://railsdevs.com) is closing in on the first 100 developer profiles! There's a lot of upcoming work planned like in-app messaging, payments, and moderation. Check out the GitHub repo if you'd like to get involved in the open source development.
